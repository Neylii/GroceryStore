### Menu
**1** - If you press 1 you'll see all articles available in the store. You type the digit of the article you want to buy and press enter. If you press 0,  you go back to the main menu.

**2** - You will see your cart if you press 2, and you will also get the option to remove an article from cart (1=yes, 2=no). Removing an article works the same way as buying an article - press the digit of the article you want to remove.

**4** - Leave the store by pressing 4 if you don't want to buy anything. If you have articles in your cart, you will leave without them.
